# Blind-Warrior-game
(WIP) Game inspired by MagictheNoah's game on youtube. Players cannot see the board, with the goal being to either get to certain place, or to be the last player standing. Program designed with the idea of assisting the "Game Master" in keeping track of the board and enemies, but a mode for players may also be implemented.
